    <statement>
        <p>A fractal is constructed with a a horizontal line _______ as the intiator and the following generator:</p>
        <p> {{gen_string}} </p>
        <p>To help you interpret this drawing, note that _ has width 1, /\ has width 1, \_/ has width 2, and | has width 0.</p>
        <p>Determine the fractal dimension of the curve generated by this set up.</p>
    </statement>
    <answer>
        <p> Scaling the fractal by a factor of {{scale}} requires {{pieces}} copies of the orginal. The fractal dimension is
            <me> \frac{\ln({{pieces}})}{\ln({{scale}})} \approx {{dimension}}</me>
        </p>
