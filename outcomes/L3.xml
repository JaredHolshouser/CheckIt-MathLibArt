    <statement>
        <p>
        Are the following statements logically equivalent? Use truth tables with the symbols P and Q to determine the answer. Make sure your tables are in the standard order.
            <ol>
                <li>{{first_string}}</li>
                <li>{{second_string}}</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
    </statement>
    <answer>
        <p> In symbols, the first statement is <m>{{first_latex}}</m> and the second is <m>{{second_latex}}</m>. The two statements are {{answer}}, as you can see by the final column of their truth tables.</p>
        <m>
        {{first_table}}
        </m>
        <m>
        {{second_table}}
        </m>
    </answer>
