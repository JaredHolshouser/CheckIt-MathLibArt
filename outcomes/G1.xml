    <statement>
        <p> A {{shape_1}} {{shape_1_orientation}} and a {{shape_2}} is attached cleanly {{shape_2_orientation}} of the {{shape_1_short}}. The dimensions of the shape are as follows: {{dimensions}}, where everything is measured in {{units_long}}.
            <ol>
                <li>Sketch a drawing of this situation to the best of your ability.</li>
                <li>Find the total area of this shape.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
    </statement>
    <answer>
        <p>
            The volume is <m>A \approx {{total_area}}</m> <m>{{units_short}}^2</m>. This was computed using the formula <m>A = {{formula}}</m>.
