                    A bag contains {{n}} tiles, {{r}} of them are red, {{b}} of them are blue, and {{g}} of them are green. Reaching into the bag, you pull a tile at random. What is the probability you draw

                        <li> a {{color1}} tile or a {{color2}} tile? </li>

                    A board is laid out in a grid. The top is broken into columns, labeled A to {{end_letter}}, and the side is broken into rows, labeled 1 to {{end_number}}. If you pick a spot on the board at random, what is the probability that the spot

                        <li> is in columns {{start_col}} to {{end_col}} or is in rows {{start_row}} to {{end_row}}? </li>
