    <statement>
        <p> A {{object_1}} {{object_1_orientation}} and a {{object_2}} is attached cleanly {{object_2_orientation}} of the {{object_1}}. The dimensions of the shape are as follows: {{dimensions}}, where everything is measured in {{units_long}}.
            <ol>
                <li>Sketch a drawing of this situation to the best of your ability.</li>
                <li>Find the total volume of this shape.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
    </statement>
    <answer>
        <p>
            The volume is <m>V \approx {{total_volume}}</m> <m>{{units_short}}^3</m>. This was computed using the formula <me>V = {{formula}}</me>.
