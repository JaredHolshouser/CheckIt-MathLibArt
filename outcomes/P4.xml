    <statement>
        <p>
            A certain {{problem}} is known to be present in about {{sick_prob}}% of {{population}}. {{researchers}} have developed a new test for this {{problem}}. Based on their research, the new test has a false negative rate of {{false_negative}}% and a false positive rate of {{false_positive}}%. 
            <ol>
                <li>Draw a tree describing this situation.</li>
                <li>What is the probability that a randomly selected {{subject}} tests {{question}}?</li>
            </ol>
        </p>

    <answer>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Your conditional probability tree should have two levels. The first level splits on whether or not the {{problem}} is present. Below those options, the tree splits on whether the test results are positive or negative. Below the branch where the {{problem}} is present, there are true positive and false negative options. Below the branch where the {{problem}} is not present, there are false positive and true negative options. Each of the different pairs of options ({{problem}} or not, true positive or false negative, and false positive or true negative) should add up to 100%.</li>
                <li>The probability is <m>{{prob_string}} \approx {{prob}}</m></li>
            </ol>
