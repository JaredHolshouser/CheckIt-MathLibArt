            In front of you is a jar containing marbles. It has 38 red marbles, 16 green marbles, 20 blue marbles, 34 yellow marbles, 49 black marbles, and 28 white marbles,  for a total of 185 marbles. Suppose you draw 2 marbles, setting each of them to the side as you pull them out. What is the probability that marble 1 is blue, and marble 2 is green?

    <answer>
        <p>
            The probability is <m>\left( \frac{20}{185} \right)\left( \frac{16}{184} \right) = 0.009400705052878966</m>.
