                After saving your loose change over the years, you have a container full of coins. It has 38 pennies, 16 nickels, 20 dimes, and 34 quarters, for a total of 108 coins.
            Suppose you draw 3 coins, putting them back in the container and shaking between selections. What is the probability that coin 1 is a dime, coin 2 is a dime, and coin 3 is a nickel?

    <answer>
        <p>
            The probability is <m>\left( \frac{20}{108} \right)\left( \frac{20}{108} \right)\left( \frac{16}{108} \right) = 0.005080526342529085</m>.
