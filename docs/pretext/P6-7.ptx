            <ol>
                <li>The probability is <me>\frac{1}{(26)(26)(26)(26)(26)(26)(26)(10)(9)(8)} = \frac{1}{5782903326720}</me></li>
                <li>The probability is <me>\frac{(\,_{13}C_4)\cdot 1}{\,_{52}C_5} = \frac{11}{39984}</me></li>
                <li>The probability is <me>\frac{\,_{14}P_{7}}{\,_{34}P_{7}} = 0.0006379637505725316</me></li>
