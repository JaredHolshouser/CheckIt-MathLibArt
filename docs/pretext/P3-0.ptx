        <p>
                In front of you is a jar containing marbles. It has 42 red marbles, 12 blue marbles, 11 yellow marbles, 31 black marbles, and 43 white marbles, for a total of 139 marbles.
            Suppose you draw 2 marbles, putting them back in the container and shaking between selections. What is the probability that marble 1 is blue, and marble 2 is black?

    </statement>
    <answer>
        <p>
            The probability is <m>\left( \frac{12}{139} \right)\left( \frac{31}{139} \right) = 0.019253661818746444</m>.
