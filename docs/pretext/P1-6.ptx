\begin{array} {llll} \{(1,1), &amp; (1,2), &amp; (1,3), &amp; (1,4), \\ (2,1), &amp; (2,2), &amp; (2,3), &amp; (2,4), \\ (3,1), &amp; (3,2), &amp; (3,3), &amp; (3,4), \\ (4,1), &amp; (4,2), &amp; (4,3), &amp; (4,4), \\ (5,1), &amp; (5,2), &amp; (5,3), &amp; (5,4) \}\end{array}
        </me>
        <p>
        The probability is 8/20.
