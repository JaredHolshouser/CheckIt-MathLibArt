                    Suppose you wake in the morning and are feeling truly indecisive. You decide at last that you want to wear shoes, pants and a shirt, and you don't care how they match. You look in your closet and count 2 pairs of shoes, 4 clean pairs of pants, and 2 clean shirts.

                        <li>Draw a tree diagram to display all of the possible outfits you could wear. </li>
                        <li>What is the total number of outfits you could possibly wear?</li>
                    </ol>

                <li>This should be checked by a human being. The tree should start with a dot and then have three successive layers after that. Draw 2 lines eminating from that initial dot and label the ends appropriately. From each of those ends, you should have 4 lines coming out. These should also be labeled. Finally, from each of the ends of the second layer, you should have 2 lines extending out and correctly labeled according to the problem.</li>
                <li>There are 16 total possibilities.</li>
            </ol>
