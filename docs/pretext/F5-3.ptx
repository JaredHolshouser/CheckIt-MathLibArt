                        <li>How much will they end up paying back overall?</li>
                        <li>How much interest did the bank earn from them?</li>

    <answer>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Their monthly payment is <m>\frac{P_0 (\frac{r}{n})}{1 - (1+\frac{r}{n})^{-nt}} = \frac{175000(\frac{0.054}{12})}{1 - (1 + \frac{0.054}{12})^{-12 \cdot 10}} = </m> $1,890.55.</li>
                <li>They will pay a total of <m>dnt = 1890.55\cdot 12 \cdot10 = </m> $226,866.0 overall.</li>
                <li>They will pay <m>dnt - P_0 = 226866.0 - 175000 = </m> $51,866.0 in interest to the bank.</li>
