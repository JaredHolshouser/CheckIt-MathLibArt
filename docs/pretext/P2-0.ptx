                    A bag contains 40 tiles, 3 of them are red, 3 of them are blue, and 34 of them are green. Reaching into the bag, you pull a tile at random. What is the probability you draw
                    <ol>
                        <li> a blue tile or a red tile? </li>
                        <li> anything but a blue tile? </li>

                        <li> The probability of drawing either a blue or red tile is <me>\frac{3+3}{40} = \cdots = \frac{3}{20}</me> </li>
                        <li> The probability of drawing anything but a blue tile is <me>1 - \frac{3}{40} = \cdots = \frac{37}{40}</me></li>
