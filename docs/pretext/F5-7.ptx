        Show all of your steps, and specify which formula/tool you used and why you used it. If you work this problem by hand, do not round in your intermediate steps. Round your final answer to two decimal places at the end.

    <answer>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Their monthly payment is <m>\frac{P_0 (\frac{r}{n})}{1 - (1+\frac{r}{n})^{-nt}} = \frac{289000.0(\frac{0.05}{12})}{1 - (1 + \frac{0.05}{12})^{-12 \cdot 20}} = </m> $1,907.27.</li>
                <li>They will pay a total of <m>dnt = 1907.27\cdot 12 \cdot20 = </m> $457,744.8 overall.</li>
                <li>They will pay <m>dnt - P_0 = 457744.8 - 289000.0 = </m> $168,744.8 in interest to the bank.</li>
