                After saving your loose change over the years, you have a container full of coins. It has 35 pennies, 20 nickels, 34 dimes, and 33 quarters, for a total of 122 coins.
            Suppose you draw 2 coins, setting each of them to the side as you pull them out. What is the probability that coin 1 is a penny, and coin 2 is a nickel?

    </statement>
    <answer>
        <p>
            The probability is <m>\left( \frac{35}{122} \right)\left( \frac{20}{121} \right) = 0.047419048909361876</m>.
