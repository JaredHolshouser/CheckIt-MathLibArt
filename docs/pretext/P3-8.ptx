            In front of you is a jar containing marbles. It has 47 red marbles, 35 green marbles, 20 blue marbles, 34 yellow marbles, 33 black marbles, and 39 white marbles,  for a total of 208 marbles. Suppose you draw 4 marbles, putting them back in the jar and shaking between selections. What is the probability that marble 1 is white, marble 2 is yellow, marble 3 is white, and marble 4 is red?

    <answer>
        <p>
            The probability is <m>\left( \frac{39}{208} \right)\left( \frac{34}{208} \right)\left( \frac{39}{208} \right)\left( \frac{47}{208} \right) = 0.0012985319780880178</m>.
