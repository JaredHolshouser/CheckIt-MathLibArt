        <p> In symbols, the argument is 
            <ul>
               <li> Premise 1: <m>P \rightarrow Q</m></li>
               <li> Premise 2: <m>\sim Q</m></li>
               <li> Conclusion: <m>\sim P</m></li>
            </ul>
            The argument structure is
            <ul>
               <li> <m>\square \rightarrow \triangle</m></li>
               <li> <m>\sim \triangle</m></li>
               <li> <m>\sim \square</m></li>
            </ul>
            This is valid by the law of contraposition.
