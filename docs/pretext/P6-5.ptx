                <ol>
                    <li> You know that the criteria for a password for a work computer says they must have 6 letters(A - Z) followed by 3 digits(0 - 9). The letters can't repeat, and the digits can repeat. If you put in a random password at someone's terminal, what is the probability that it is correct?</li>
                    <li>When drawing a 5 card hand from a standard 52 card poker deck, what is the probability that you draw three Diamonds?</li>

        <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The probability is <m>\frac{1}{(26)(25)(24)(23)(22)(21)(10)(10)(10)} = \frac{1}{165765600000}</m></li>
                    <li>The probability is <m>\frac{(\,_{13}C_3)(\,_{49}C_2)}{\,_{52}C_5} = \frac{11}{85}</m></li>
