            <ol>
                <li>The probability is <me>\frac{1}{(26)(25)(24)(23)(22)(21)(10)(10)(10)} = \frac{1}{165765600000}</me></li>
                <li>The probability is <me>\frac{(\,_{13}C_3)(\,_{49}C_2)}{\,_{52}C_5} = \frac{11}{85}</me></li>
                <li>The probability is <me>\frac{\,_{29}P_{5}}{\,_{39}P_{5}} = 0.20625889046941678</me></li>
