        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>They need to put <m>\frac{FV (\frac{r}{n})}{(1+\frac{r}{n})^{nt} - 1} = \frac{2400000\cdot \frac{0.054}{12}}{(1 + \frac{0.054}{12})^{36\cdot 12} - 1} = </m> $1,813.22 into retirement each month.</li>
                <li>They contributed <m>dnt = 1813.22\cdot 12 \cdot36 = </m>$783,311.04 overall.</li>
                <li><m>FV - dnt = 2400000 - 783311.04 = </m> $1,616,688.96 in interest was generated.</li>
