    <statement>
        <p>
            A certain error is known to be present in about 14% of gadgets. Engineers have developed a new test for this error. Based on their research, the new test has a false negative rate of 19% and a false positive rate of 13%. 
            <ol>
                <li>Draw a tree describing this situation.</li>
                <li>What is the probability that a randomly selected gadget tests positive?</li>
            </ol>
        </p>

    <answer>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>See the class notes for how to draw a tree.</li>
                <li>The probability is <me>P(positive) = P(defective)P(positive|defective) + P(not defective)P(positive|not defective) \approx 0.2252</me></li>
