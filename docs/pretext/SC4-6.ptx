                <li>This should be checked by a human being. The tree should start with a dot and then have three successive layers after that. Draw 3 lines eminating from that initial dot and label the ends appropriately. From each of those ends, you should have 2 lines coming out. These should also be labeled. Finally, from each of the ends of the second layer, you should have 3 lines extending out and correctly labeled according to the problem.</li>
