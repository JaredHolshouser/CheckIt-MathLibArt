    <statement>
        <p> A cylinder stands upright and a cone is attached cleanly to the top of the cylinder. The dimensions of the shape are as follows: the cylinder has radius 11 and side length 3, and the cone has altitude 8, where everything is measured in centimeters.
            <ol>
                <li>Sketch a drawing of this situation to the best of your ability.</li>
                <li>Find the total volume of this shape.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
    </statement>
    <answer>
        <p>
            The volume is <m>V \approx 2154.09</m> <m>cm^3</m>. This was computed using the formula <m>V = \pi r^2h_1 + \frac{1}{3}\pi r^2h_2</m>.
