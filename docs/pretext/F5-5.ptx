    <answer>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Their monthly payment is <m>\frac{P_0 (\frac{r}{n})}{1 - (1+\frac{r}{n})^{-nt}} = \frac{21000(\frac{0.042}{12})}{1 - (1 + \frac{0.042}{12})^{-12 \cdot 7}} = </m> $288.98.</li>
                <li>They will pay a total of <m>dnt = 288.98\cdot 12 \cdot7 = </m> $24,274.32 overall.</li>
                <li>They will pay <m>dnt - P_0 = 24274.32 - 21000 = </m> $3,274.32 in interest to the bank.</li>
