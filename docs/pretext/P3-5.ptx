                In front of you is a jar containing marbles. It has 44 red marbles, 23 blue marbles, 29 yellow marbles, 32 black marbles, and 23 white marbles, for a total of 151 marbles.
            Suppose you draw 4 marbles, putting them back in the container and shaking between selections. What is the probability that marble 1 is yellow, marble 2 is blue, marble 3 is black, and marble 4 is yellow?

        <p>
            The probability is <m>\left( \frac{29}{151} \right)\left( \frac{23}{151} \right)\left( \frac{32}{151} \right)\left( \frac{29}{151} \right) = 0.001190600391334939</m>.
