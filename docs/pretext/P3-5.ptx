        <p>
            In front of you is a jar containing marbles. It has 10 red marbles, 44 green marbles, 23 blue marbles, 29 yellow marbles, 32 black marbles, and 23 white marbles,  for a total of 161 marbles. Suppose you draw 4 marbles, putting them back in the jar and shaking between selections. What is the probability that marble 1 is blue, marble 2 is green, marble 3 is yellow, and marble 4 is blue?

    <answer>
        <p>
            The probability is <m>\left( \frac{23}{161} \right)\left( \frac{44}{161} \right)\left( \frac{29}{161} \right)\left( \frac{23}{161} \right) = 0.0010046223651298412</m>.
