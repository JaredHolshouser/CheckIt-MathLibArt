            A survey asks 500 people the following question: "Do you prefer football or basketball?" In their answer, the respondents can specify one of the two options, both, or neither. Suppose 98 report neither football nor basketball, 325 report football, 171 report football and basketball, and 77 report basketball only.

                <li>This currently needs to be checked by a human being. In general you should draw overlapping circles contained in a larger rectangle. The numbers from the problem should go into their corresponding places, whether thats an entire circle, the little oval overlap part, the crescent moon shaped portions, or outside of the circles all together.</li>
                <li>248 report basketball.</li>
                <li>252 report that they do no prefer basketball.</li>
