            A survey asks 500 people the following question: "Do you prefer football or basketball?" In their answer, the respondents can specify one of the two options, both, or neither. Suppose 98 reported that they prefer neither football nor basketball, 325 reported that they prefer football, 171 reported that they prefer both football and basketball, and 77 reported that they prefer basketball only.
