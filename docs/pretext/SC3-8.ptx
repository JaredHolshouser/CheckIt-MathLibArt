            A survey asks 600 people the following question: "Do you prefer beer or wine?" In their answer, the respondents can specify one of the two options, both, or neither. Suppose 100 reported that they prefer both beer and wine, 70 reported that they prefer wine only, 293 reported that they prefer beer, and 237 reported that they prefer neither beer nor wine.
            <ol>
                <li>Draw a Venn diagram of the situation. Use the information in the problem to clearly label the diagram.</li>
                <li>How many people  reported that they do not prefer wine?</li>
                <li>How many people  reported that they do not prefer beer?</li>

            <ol>
                <li>In general you should draw overlapping circles contained in a larger rectangle. From the information given in this problem, 600 is the amount for the entire rectangle, 100 is the number for the little oval overlap part, 70 is the number for the crescent moon part of wine, 293 is the number for the entire beer circle, and 237 is the number for the portion outside of both circles.</li>
                <li>430 reported that they do not prefer wine.</li>
                <li>307 reported that they do not prefer beer.</li>
