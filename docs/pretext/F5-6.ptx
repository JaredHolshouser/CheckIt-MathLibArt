    <answer>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Their monthly payment is <m>\frac{P_0 (\frac{r}{n})}{1 - (1+\frac{r}{n})^{-nt}} = \frac{120000(\frac{0.054}{12})}{1 - (1 + \frac{0.054}{12})^{-12 \cdot 10}} = </m> $1,296.38.</li>
                <li>They will pay a total of <m>dnt = 1296.38\cdot 12 \cdot10 = </m> $155,565.6 overall.</li>
                <li>They will pay <m>dnt - P_0 = 155565.6 - 120000 = </m> $35,565.6 in interest to the bank.</li>
