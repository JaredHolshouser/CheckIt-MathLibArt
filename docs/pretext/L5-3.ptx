    <statement>
        <p>
            Use a common form of argument to decide if the following argument is valid. Cite the argument form you are matching by name, and state how you are assigning the variables P, Q, and possibly R in order to line up with that form.

        <p>if there is no traffic today, then I have an unhealthy diet. It is false that there is no traffic today. Therefore, it is false that I have an unhealthy diet.</p>

    <answer>
        <p> In symbols, the argument is 
            <ul>
               <li> Premise 1: <m>P \rightarrow Q</m></li>
               <li> Premise 2: <m>\sim P</m></li>
               <li> Conclusion: <m>\sim Q</m></li>
            </ul>
            The argument structure is
            <ul>
               <li> <m>\square \rightarrow \triangle</m></li>
               <li> <m>\sim \square</m></li>
               <li> <m>\sim \triangle</m></li>
            </ul>
            This is not valid by the fallacy of the inverse.
