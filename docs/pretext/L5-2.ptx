    <statement>
        <p>
            Use a common form of argument to decide if the following argument is valid. Cite the argument form you are matching by name, and state how you are assigning the variables P, Q, and possibly R in order to line up with that form.

        <p>if I slept well last night, then I am in a bad mood. It is false that I slept well last night. Therefore, it is false that I am in a bad mood.</p>
    </statement>
    <answer>
        <p> In symbols, the argument is 
            <ul>
               <li> Premise 1: <m>P \rightarrow Q</m></li>
               <li> Premise 2: <m>\sim P</m></li>
               <li> Conclusion: <m>\sim Q</m></li>
            </ul>
            The argument structure is
            <ul>
               <li> <m>\square \rightarrow \triangle</m></li>
               <li> <m>\sim \square</m></li>
               <li> <m>\sim \triangle</m></li>
            </ul>
            This is not valid by the fallacy of the inverse.
