                <li> You know that the criteria for a password for a work computer says they must have 7 letters(A - Z) followed by 3 digits(0 - 9). The letters can't repeat, and the digits can repeat. If you put in a random password at someone's terminal, what is the probability that it is correct?</li>

            <ol>
                <li>The probability is <me>\frac{1}{(26)(25)(24)(23)(22)(21)(20)(10)(10)(10)} = \frac{1}{3315312000000}</me></li>
                <li>The probability is <me>\frac{(\,_{4}C_1) \cdot 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 \cdot (\,_{49}C_2)}{\,_{52}C_5} = \frac{2}{1105}</me></li>
                <li>The probability is <me>\frac{\,_{26}P_{6}}{\,_{37}P_{6}} = 0.09903285638579756</me></li>
