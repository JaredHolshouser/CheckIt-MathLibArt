                <ol>
                    <li>From a pool of 37 candidates, 6 people will be selected at random to go on an expedition. They will all be assigned unique tasks. You and 11 of your friends are all in the pool of candidates. What is the probability that a team is selected that  does not include you or any of your friends?</li>
                    <li> You know that the criteria for a password for an insurance website says they must have 7 letters(A - Z) followed by 3 digits(0 - 9). The letters can repeat, and the digits can't repeat. If you put in a random password at someone's terminal, what is the probability that it is correct?</li>

                <ol>
                    <li>The probability is <m>\frac{\,_{25}P_{6}}{\,_{37}P_{6}} = 0.07617912029676735</m></li>
                    <li>The probability is <m>\frac{1}{(26)(26)(26)(26)(26)(26)(26)(10)(9)(8)} = \frac{1}{5782903326720}</m></li>
