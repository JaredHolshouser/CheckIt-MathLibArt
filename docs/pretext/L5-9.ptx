        <p> In symbols, the argument is 
            <ul>
               <li> Premise 1: <m>\sim P \rightarrow Q</m></li>
               <li> Premise 2: <m>Q</m></li>
               <li> Conclusion: <m>\sim P</m></li>
            </ul>
            The argument structure is
            <ul>
               <li> <m>\square \rightarrow \triangle</m></li>
               <li> <m>\triangle</m></li>
               <li> <m>\square</m></li>
            </ul>
            This is not valid by the fallacy of the converse.
