            In front of you is a jar containing marbles. It has 36 red marbles, 32 green marbles, 28 blue marbles, 35 yellow marbles, 36 black marbles, and 24 white marbles,  for a total of 191 marbles. Suppose you draw 2 marbles, setting each of them to the side as you pull them out. What is the probability that marble 1 is white, and marble 2 is black?

    <answer>
        <p>
            The probability is <m>\left( \frac{24}{191} \right)\left( \frac{36}{190} \right) = 0.02380821162854781</m>.
