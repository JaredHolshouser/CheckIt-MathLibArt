                At a state fair, there is a jar containing jellybeans. It has 32 grape jellybeans, 28 cherry jellybeans, 35 butter jellybeans, and 36 licorice jellybeans, for a total of 131 jellybeans.
            Suppose you draw 2 jellybeans, setting each of them to the side as you pull them out. What is the probability that jellybean 1 is grape flavored, and jellybean 2 is butter flavored?

    </statement>
    <answer>
        <p>
            The probability is <m>\left( \frac{32}{131} \right)\left( \frac{35}{130} \right) = 0.06576629477392835</m>.
