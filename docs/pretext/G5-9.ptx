    <statement>
        <p>A fractal is constructed with a a horizontal line _______ as the intiator and the following generator:</p>
        <p> \_/&#8254;|/&#8254;|_/&#8254;\_/&#8254; </p>
        <p>To help you interpret this drawing, note that _ has width 1, /\ has width 1, \_/ has width 2, and | has width 0.</p>
        <p>Determine the fractal dimension of the curve generated by this set up.</p>
    </statement>
    <answer>
        <p> Scaling the fractal by a factor of 10.0 requires 15 copies of the orginal. The fractal dimension is
            <me> \frac{\ln(15)}{\ln(10.0)} \approx 1.176</me>
        </p>
