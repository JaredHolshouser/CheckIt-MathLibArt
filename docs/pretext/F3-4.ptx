        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>They need to put <m>\frac{FV (\frac{r}{n})}{(1+\frac{r}{n})^{nt} - 1} = \frac{1900000\cdot \frac{0.049}{12}}{(1 + \frac{0.049}{12})^{34\cdot 12} - 1} = </m> $1,815.65 into retirement each month.</li>
                <li>They contributed <m>dnt = 1815.65\cdot 12 \cdot34 = </m>$740,785.2 overall.</li>
                <li><m>FV - dnt = 1900000 - 740785.2 = </m> $1,159,214.8 in interest was generated.</li>
