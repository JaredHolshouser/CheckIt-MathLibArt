            <ol>
                <li>The probability is <me>\frac{1}{(26)(26)(26)(26)(26)(26)(26)(10)(10)(10)} = \frac{1}{8031810176000}</me></li>
                <li>The probability is <me>\frac{(\,_{4}C_2)(\,_{48}C_3)}{\,_{52}C_5} = \frac{2162}{54145}</me></li>
                <li>The probability is <me>\frac{\,_{18}P_{8}}{\,_{33}P_{8}} = 0.0031516499814608825</me></li>
