            <ol>
                <li>The probability is <me>\frac{1}{(26)(25)(24)(23)(22)(21)(20)(19)(10)(10)(10)} = \frac{1}{62990928000000}</me></li>
                <li>The probability is <me>\frac{(\,_{13}C_3)(\,_{49}C_2)}{\,_{52}C_5} = \frac{11}{85}</me></li>
                <li>The probability is <me>\frac{\,_{12}P_{5}}{\,_{23}P_{5}} = 0.02353710362863681</me></li>
