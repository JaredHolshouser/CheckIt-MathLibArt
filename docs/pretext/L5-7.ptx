    <statement>
        <p>
            Use a common form of argument to decide if the following argument is valid. Cite the argument form you are matching by name, and state how you are assigning the variables P, Q, and possibly R in order to line up with that form.

        <p>if it is false that I slept poorly last night, then I exercise regularly. I exercise regularly. Therefore, it is false that I slept poorly last night.</p>
    </statement>
    <answer>
        <p> In symbols, the argument is 
            <ul>
               <li> Premise 1: <m>\sim P \rightarrow Q</m></li>
               <li> Premise 2: <m>Q</m></li>
               <li> Conclusion: <m>\sim P</m></li>
            </ul>
            The argument structure is
            <ul>
               <li> <m>\square \rightarrow \triangle</m></li>
               <li> <m>\triangle</m></li>
               <li> <m>\square</m></li>
            </ul>
            This is not valid by the fallacy of the converse.
