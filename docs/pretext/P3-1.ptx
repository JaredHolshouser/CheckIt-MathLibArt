                At a state fair, there is a jar containing jellybeans. It has 48 grape jellybeans, 19 cherry jellybeans, 37 butter jellybeans, and 39 licorice jellybeans, for a total of 143 jellybeans.
            Suppose you draw 3 jellybeans, putting them back in the container and shaking between selections. What is the probability that jellybean 1 is cherry flavored, jellybean 2 is grape flavored, and jellybean 3 is butter flavored?

    <answer>
        <p>
            The probability is <m>\left( \frac{19}{143} \right)\left( \frac{48}{143} \right)\left( \frac{37}{143} \right) = 0.011539538753583451</m>.
