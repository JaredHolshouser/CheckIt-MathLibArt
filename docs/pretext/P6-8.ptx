            <ol>
                <li>The probability is <me>\frac{1}{(26)(25)(24)(23)(22)(21)(20)(19)(10)(9)} = \frac{1}{5669183520000}</me></li>
                <li>The probability is <me>\frac{(\,_{4}C_2)(\,_{4}C_2)(\,_{44}C_1)}{\,_{52}C_5} = \frac{33}{54145}</me></li>
                <li>The probability is <me>\frac{\,_{18}P_{8}}{\,_{28}P_{8}} = 0.014078674948240166</me></li>
