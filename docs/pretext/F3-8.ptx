        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>They need to put <m>\frac{FV (\frac{r}{n})}{(1+\frac{r}{n})^{nt} - 1} = \frac{2700000\cdot \frac{0.044}{12}}{(1 + \frac{0.044}{12})^{30\cdot 12} - 1} = </m> $3,620.54 into retirement each month.</li>
                <li>They contributed <m>dnt = 3620.54\cdot 12 \cdot30 = </m>$1,303,394.4 overall.</li>
                <li><m>FV - dnt = 2700000 - 1303394.4 = </m> $1,396,605.6 in interest was generated.</li>
