    <statement>
        <p>A fractal is constructed with a horizontal line as the intiator and the following generator:</p>
        <p> _/&#8254;\_/&#8254;\_|\ </p>
        <p>To help you interpret this drawing, note that _ has width 1, / and \ have width 0.5, and | has width 0. So for example, \_| has width 0.5 + 1 + 0 = 1.5</p>
        <p>Determine the fractal dimension of the curve generated by this set up.</p>
    </statement>
    <answer>
        <p> This generator has width 7.5 and uses 11 line segements. So scaling the fractal by a factor of 7.5 requires 11 copies of the orginal shape. This means the fractal dimension is
            <m> \frac{\ln(11)}{\ln(7.5)} \approx 1.19</m>
        </p>
