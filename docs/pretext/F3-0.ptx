            <ol>
                <li>They need to put <m>\frac{FV (\frac{r}{n})}{(1+\frac{r}{n})^{nt} - 1} = \frac{1500000\cdot \frac{0.043}{12}}{(1 + \frac{0.043}{12})^{26\cdot 12} - 1} = </m> $2,618.6 into retirement each month.</li>
                <li>They contributed <m>dnt = 2618.6\cdot 12 \cdot26 = </m>$817,003.2 overall.</li>
                <li><m>FV - dnt = 1500000 - 817003.2 = </m> $682,996.8 in interest was generated.</li>
