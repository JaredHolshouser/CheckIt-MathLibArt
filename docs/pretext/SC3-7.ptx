            A survey asks 800 people the following question: "Do you prefer beer or wine?" In their answer, the respondents can specify one of the two options, both, or neither. Suppose 187 reported that they prefer wine only, 102 reported that they prefer neither beer nor wine, 197 reported that they prefer both beer and wine, and 314 reported that they prefer beer only.

                <li>In general you should draw overlapping circles contained in a larger rectangle. From the information given in this problem, 800 is the amount for the entire rectangle, 187 is the number for the crescent moon part of wine, 102 is the number for the portion outside of both circles, 197 is the number for the little oval overlap part, and 314 is the number for the crescent moon part of beer.</li>
