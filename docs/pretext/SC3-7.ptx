        <p>
            A survey asks 800 people the following question: "Do you prefer beer or wine?" In their answer, the respondents can specify one of the two options, both, or neither. Suppose 187 report wine only, 102 report neither beer nor wine, 197 report beer and wine, and 314 report beer only.
            <ol>
                <li>Draw a Venn diagram of the situation. Use the information in the problem to clearly label the diagram.</li>
                <li>How many people  reported that they prefer wine?</li>
                <li>How many people  reported that they did not prefer wine?</li>
            </ol>

        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>This currently needs to be checked by a human being. In general you should draw overlapping circles contained in a larger rectangle. The numbers from the problem should go into their corresponding places, whether thats an entire circle, the little oval overlap part, the crescent moon shaped portions, or outside of the circles all together.</li>
                <li>384 report wine.</li>
                <li>416 report that they do no prefer wine.</li>
