                    Using the initiator and generator shown, draw the next two stages of the iterated fractal. If your lines intersect themselves a little bit, that's okay, but try to keep your picture as neat as possible.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Initiator: ___</li>
                        <li>Generator: \_|</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Using the initiator and generator shown, draw the next three stages of the iterated fractal. This is a tree, so you should only interate on the branches.
                                        <ul>
                        <li>Initiator: --</li>
                        <li>Generator: -&gt;-</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>

    <answer>
        <ol>
            <li>This must be checked by a human being. As some general advice, draw big and make sure that when you iterate, the generator is repeated in every single line segment.</li>
            <li>Same as the first part, except you only repeat on the branches.</li>
        </ol>
    </answer>
