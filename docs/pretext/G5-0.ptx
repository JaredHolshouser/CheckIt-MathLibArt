    <statement>
        <p>A fractal is constructed with a horizontal line as the intiator and the following generator:</p>
        <p> /\/&#8254;\_|&#8254;|_ </p>
        <p>To help you interpret this drawing, note that _ has width 1, / and \ have width 0.5, and | has width 0. So for example, \_| has width 0.5 + 1 + 0 = 1.5</p>
        <p>Determine the fractal dimension of the curve generated by this set up.</p>
    </statement>
    <answer>
        <p> This generator has width 6.0 and uses 10 line segements. So scaling the fractal by a factor of 6.0 requires 10 copies of the orginal shape. This means the fractal dimension is
            <m> \frac{\ln(10)}{\ln(6.0)} \approx 1.285</m>
        </p>
