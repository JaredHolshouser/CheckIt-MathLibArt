            A survey asks 400 people the following question: "Do you prefer shopping online or shopping in a store?" In their answer, the respondents can specify one of the two options, both, or neither. Suppose 82 reported that they prefer both shopping online and shopping in a store, 204 reported that they prefer shopping in a store, 142 reported that they prefer neither shopping online nor shopping in a store, and 54 reported that they prefer shopping online only.
