                After saving your loose change over the years, you have a container full of coins. It has 26 pennies, 29 nickels, 46 dimes, and 30 quarters, for a total of 131 coins.
            Suppose you draw 3 coins, setting each of them to the side as you pull them out. What is the probability that coin 1 is a nickel, coin 2 is a dime, and coin 3 is a dime?

    <answer>
        <p>
            The probability is <m>\left( \frac{29}{131} \right)\left( \frac{46}{130} \right)\left( \frac{45}{129} \right) = 0.027325240000546234</m>.
