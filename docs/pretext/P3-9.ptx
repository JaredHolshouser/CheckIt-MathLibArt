            In front of you is a jar containing marbles. It has 48 red marbles, 26 green marbles, 29 blue marbles, 46 yellow marbles, 30 black marbles, and 23 white marbles,  for a total of 202 marbles. Suppose you draw 4 marbles, setting each of them to the side as you pull them out. What is the probability that marble 1 is blue, marble 2 is black, marble 3 is white, and marble 4 is white?

    <answer>
        <p>
            The probability is <m>\left( \frac{29}{202} \right)\left( \frac{30}{201} \right)\left( \frac{23}{200} \right)\left( \frac{22}{199} \right) = 0.00027242017684105466</m>.
