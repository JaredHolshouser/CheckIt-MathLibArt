            <ol>
                <li>They need to put <m>\frac{FV (\frac{r}{n})}{(1+\frac{r}{n})^{nt} - 1} = \frac{3500000\cdot \frac{0.054}{12}}{(1 + \frac{0.054}{12})^{40\cdot 12} - 1} = </m> $2,064.43 into retirement each month.</li>
                <li>They contributed <m>dnt = 2064.43\cdot 12 \cdot40 = </m>$990,926.4 overall.</li>
                <li><m>FV - dnt = 3500000 - 990926.4 = </m> $2,509,073.6 in interest was generated.</li>
