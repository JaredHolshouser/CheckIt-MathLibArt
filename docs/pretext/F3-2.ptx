        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>They need to put <m>\frac{FV (\frac{r}{n})}{(1+\frac{r}{n})^{nt} - 1} = \frac{2000000\cdot \frac{0.045}{12}}{(1 + \frac{0.045}{12})^{28\cdot 12} - 1} = </m> $2,979.59 into retirement each month.</li>
                <li>They contributed <m>dnt = 2979.59\cdot 12 \cdot28 = </m>$1,001,142.24 overall.</li>
                <li><m>FV - dnt = 2000000 - 1001142.24 = </m> $998,857.76 in interest was generated.</li>
