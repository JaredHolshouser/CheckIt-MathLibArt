            <ol>
                <li>They need to put <m>\frac{FV (\frac{r}{n})}{(1+\frac{r}{n})^{nt} - 1} = \frac{2800000\cdot \frac{0.047}{12}}{(1 + \frac{0.047}{12})^{29\cdot 12} - 1} = </m> $3,784.86 into retirement each month.</li>
                <li>They contributed <m>dnt = 3784.86\cdot 12 \cdot29 = </m>$1,317,131.28 overall.</li>
                <li><m>FV - dnt = 2800000 - 1317131.28 = </m> $1,482,868.72 in interest was generated.</li>
