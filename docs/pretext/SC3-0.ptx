            A survey asks 800 people the following question: "Do you prefer phone calls or texts?" In their answer, the respondents can specify one of the two options, both, or neither. Suppose 383 reported that they prefer phone calls, 258 reported that they prefer phone calls only, 125 reported that they prefer both phone calls and texts, and 88 reported that they prefer neither phone calls nor texts.
            <ol>
                <li>Draw a Venn diagram of the situation. Use the information in the problem to clearly label the diagram.</li>
                <li>How many people  reported that they prefer texts?</li>
                <li>How many people  reported that they prefer texts only?</li>

            <ol>
                <li>In general you should draw overlapping circles contained in a larger rectangle. From the information given in this problem, 800 is the amount for the entire rectangle, 383 is the number for the entire phone calls circle, 258 is the number for the crescent moon part of phone calls, 125 is the number for the little oval overlap part, and 88 is the number for the portion outside of both circles.</li>
                <li>454 reported that they prefer texts.</li>
                <li>329 reported that they prefer texts only.</li>
