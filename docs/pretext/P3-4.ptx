                After saving your loose change over the years, you have a container full of coins. It has 28 pennies, 29 nickels, 19 dimes, and 43 quarters, for a total of 119 coins.
            Suppose you draw 2 coins, putting them back in the container and shaking between selections. What is the probability that coin 1 is a dime, and coin 2 is a nickel?

    </statement>
    <answer>
        <p>
            The probability is <m>\left( \frac{19}{119} \right)\left( \frac{29}{119} \right) = 0.038909681519666686</m>.
