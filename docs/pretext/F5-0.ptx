    <answer>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Their monthly payment is <m>\frac{P_0 (\frac{r}{n})}{1 - (1+\frac{r}{n})^{-nt}} = \frac{31000(\frac{0.053}{12})}{1 - (1 + \frac{0.053}{12})^{-12 \cdot 9}} = </m> $361.54.</li>
                <li>They will pay a total of <m>dnt = 361.54\cdot 12 \cdot9 = </m> $39,046.32 overall.</li>
                <li>They will pay <m>dnt - P_0 = 39046.32 - 31000 = </m> $8,046.32 in interest to the bank.</li>
