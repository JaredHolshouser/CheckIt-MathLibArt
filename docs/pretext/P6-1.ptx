            <ol>
                <li>The probability is <me>\frac{1}{(26)(25)(24)(23)(22)(21)(10)(10)(10)} = \frac{1}{165765600000}</me></li>
                <li>The probability is <me>\frac{(\,_{13}C_4)\cdot 1}{\,_{52}C_5} = \frac{11}{39984}</me></li>
                <li>The probability is <me>\frac{\,_{11}P_{7}}{\,_{26}P_{7}} = 0.0005016722408026755</me></li>
