            <ol>
                <li>The probability is <me>\frac{1}{(26)(25)(24)(23)(22)(21)(20)(10)(9)(8)} = \frac{1}{2387024640000}</me></li>
                <li>The probability is <me>\frac{(\,_{13}C_4)\cdot 1}{\,_{52}C_5} = \frac{11}{39984}</me></li>
                <li>The probability is <me>\frac{\,_{14}P_{4}}{\,_{39}P_{4}} = 0.01217006480164375</me></li>
