        <p>
            A certain virus is known to be present in about 13% of children. Scientists have developed a new test for this virus. Based on their research, the new test has a false negative rate of 14% and a false positive rate of 12%. 
            <ol>
                <li>Draw a tree describing this situation.</li>
                <li>What is the probability that a randomly selected child tests negative?</li>
            </ol>

                <li>Your conditional probability tree should have two levels. The first level splits on whether or not the virus is present. Below those options, the tree splits on whether the test results are positive or negative. Below the branch where the virus is present, there are true positive and false negative options. Below the branch where the virus is not present, there are false positive and true negative options. Each of the different pairs of options (virus or not, true positive or false negative, and false positive or true negative) should add up to 100%.</li>
                <li>The probability is <m>P(negative) = P(sick)P(negative|sick) + P(healthy)P(negative|healthy) \approx 0.7838</m></li>
