    <statement>
        <p>
            A certain illness is known to be present in about 7% of children. Scientists have developed a new test for this illness. Based on their research, the new test has a false negative rate of 16% and a false positive rate of 16%. 
            <ol>
                <li>Draw a tree describing this situation.</li>
                <li>What is the probability that a randomly selected child tests negative and is actually sick?</li>
            </ol>

                <li>Your conditional probability tree should have two levels. The first level splits on whether or not the illness is present. Below those options, the tree splits on whether the test results are positive or negative. Below the branch where the illness is present, there are true positive and false negative options. Below the branch where the illness is not present, there are false positive and true negative options. Each of the different pairs of options (illness or not, true positive or false negative, and false positive or true negative) should add up to 100%.</li>
                <li>The probability is <m>P(negative\, and\, healthy) = P(healthy)P(negative|healthy) \approx 0.7812</m></li>
