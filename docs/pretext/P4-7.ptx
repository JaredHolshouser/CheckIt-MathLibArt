    <statement>
        <p>
            A certain bacteria is known to be present in about 14% of people. Doctors have developed a new test for this bacteria. Based on their research, the new test has a false negative rate of 17% and a false positive rate of 11%. 
            <ol>
                <li>Draw a tree describing this situation.</li>
                <li>What is the probability that a randomly selected person tests negative?</li>
            </ol>

    <answer>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>See the class notes for how to draw a tree.</li>
                <li>The probability is <me>P(negative) = P(sick)P(negative|sick) + P(healthy)P(negative|healthy) \approx 0.7892</me></li>
