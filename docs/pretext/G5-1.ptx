    <statement>
        <p>A fractal is constructed with a a horizontal line _______ as the intiator and the following generator:</p>
        <p> &#8254;\_|&#8254;|_/&#8254;\/ </p>
        <p>To help you interpret this drawing, note that _ has width 1, /\ has width 1, \_/ has width 2, and | has width 0.</p>
        <p>Determine the fractal dimension of the curve generated by this set up.</p>
    </statement>
    <answer>
        <p> Scaling the fractal by a factor of 7.0 requires 11 copies of the orginal. The fractal dimension is
            <me> \frac{\ln(11)}{\ln(7.0)} \approx 1.232</me>
        </p>
