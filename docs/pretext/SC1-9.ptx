    <statement>
        <p>
            You are given the sets <m>A = \left\{2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11\right\}</m>, <m>B = \left\{3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\right\}</m>, and the element <m>x = 18</m>. Determine whether the following are True or False.
            <ol>
                <li> <m>x \notin A</m> </li>
                <li> <m>A \supseteq B</m> </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
    </statement>
    <answer>
        <p>
        <m>x \notin A</m> is True because x is not one of the listed elements of A, and <m>A \supseteq B</m> is True because every element of B is also an element of A.
        </p>
