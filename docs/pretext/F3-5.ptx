        Show all of your steps, and specify which formula/tool you used and why you used it. If you work this problem by hand, do not round in your intermediate steps. Round your final answer to two decimal places at the end.

    <answer>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>They need to put <m>\frac{FV (\frac{r}{n})}{(1+\frac{r}{n})^{nt} - 1} = \frac{2400000\cdot \frac{0.044}{12}}{(1 + \frac{0.044}{12})^{31\cdot 12} - 1} = </m> $3,032.33 into retirement each month.</li>
                <li>They contributed <m>dnt = 3032.33\cdot 12 \cdot31 = </m>$1,128,026.76 overall.</li>
                <li><m>FV - dnt = 2400000 - 1128026.76 = </m> $1,271,973.24 in interest was generated.</li>
