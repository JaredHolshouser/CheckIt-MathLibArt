                After saving your loose change over the years, you have a container full of coins. It has 30 pennies, 48 nickels, 45 dimes, and 29 quarters, for a total of 152 coins.
            Suppose you draw 2 coins, setting each of them to the side as you pull them out. What is the probability that coin 1 is a penny, and coin 2 is a dime?

    </statement>
    <answer>
        <p>
            The probability is <m>\left( \frac{30}{152} \right)\left( \frac{45}{151} \right) = 0.05881840362495644</m>.
