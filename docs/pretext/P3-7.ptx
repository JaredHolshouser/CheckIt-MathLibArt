        <p>
            In front of you is a jar containing marbles. It has 43 red marbles, 30 green marbles, 48 blue marbles, 45 yellow marbles, 29 black marbles, and 45 white marbles,  for a total of 240 marbles. Suppose you draw 4 marbles, putting them back in the jar and shaking between selections. What is the probability that marble 1 is black, marble 2 is blue, marble 3 is red, and marble 4 is blue?

    <answer>
        <p>
            The probability is <m>\left( \frac{29}{240} \right)\left( \frac{48}{240} \right)\left( \frac{43}{240} \right)\left( \frac{48}{240} \right) = 0.0008659722222222224</m>.
