        <p>
            A survey asks 500 people the following question: "Do you prefer iced coffee or hot coffee?" In their answer, the respondents can specify one of the two options, both, or neither. Suppose 100 report hot coffee only, 62 report iced coffee and hot coffee, 162 report hot coffee, and 271 report neither iced coffee nor hot coffee.
            <ol>
                <li>Draw a Venn diagram of the situation. Use the information in the problem to clearly label the diagram.</li>
                <li>How many people  reported that they did not prefer iced coffee?</li>
                <li>How many people  reported that they prefer iced coffee only?</li>
            </ol>

            <ol>
                <li>This currently needs to be checked by a human being. In general you should draw overlapping circles contained in a larger rectangle. The numbers from the problem should go into their corresponding places, whether thats an entire circle, the little oval overlap part, the crescent moon shaped portions, or outside of the circles all together.</li>
                <li>371 report that they do no prefer iced coffee.</li>
                <li>67 report iced coffee only.</li>
            </ol>
