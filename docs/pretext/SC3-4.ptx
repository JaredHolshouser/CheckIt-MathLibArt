        <p>
            A survey asks 400 people the following question: "Do you prefer shopping online or shopping in a store?" In their answer, the respondents can specify one of the two options, both, or neither. Suppose 37 report shopping in a store only, 99 report shopping in a store, 139 report shopping online, and 77 report shopping online only.
            <ol>
                <li>Draw a Venn diagram of the situation. Use the information in the problem to clearly label the diagram.</li>
                <li>How many people  reported that they prefer neither shopping online nor shopping in a store?</li>
                <li>How many people  reported that they prefer shopping online and shopping in a store?</li>

            <ol>
                <li>This currently needs to be checked by a human being. In general you should draw overlapping circles contained in a larger rectangle. The numbers from the problem should go into their corresponding places, whether thats an entire circle, the little oval overlap part, the crescent moon shaped portions, or outside of the circles all together.</li>
                <li>224 report neither shopping online nor shopping in a store.</li>
                <li>62 report shopping online and shopping in a store.</li>
