    <statement>
        <p>
            A certain bacteria is known to be present in about 1% of animals. Doctors have developed a new test for this bacteria. Based on their research, the new test has a false negative rate of 18% and a false positive rate of 7%. 
            <ol>
                <li>Draw a tree describing this situation.</li>
                <li>What is the probability that a randomly selected animal tests negative and is actually healthy?</li>
            </ol>

                <li>See the class notes for how to draw a tree.</li>
                <li>The probability is <me>P(negative\, and\, sick) = P(sick)P(negative|sick) \approx 0.0018</me></li>
