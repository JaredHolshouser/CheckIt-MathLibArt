    <statement>
        <p>
            A certain bacteria is known to be present in about 1% of animals. Doctors have developed a new test for this bacteria. Based on their research, the new test has a false negative rate of 18% and a false positive rate of 7%. 
            <ol>
                <li>Draw a tree describing this situation.</li>
                <li>What is the probability that a randomly selected animal tests negative and is actually healthy?</li>
            </ol>

                <li>Your conditional probability tree should have two levels. The first level splits on whether or not the bacteria is present. Below those options, the tree splits on whether the test results are positive or negative. Below the branch where the bacteria is present, there are true positive and false negative options. Below the branch where the bacteria is not present, there are false positive and true negative options. Each of the different pairs of options (bacteria or not, true positive or false negative, and false positive or true negative) should add up to 100%.</li>
                <li>The probability is <m>P(negative\, and\, sick) = P(sick)P(negative|sick) \approx 0.0018</m></li>
