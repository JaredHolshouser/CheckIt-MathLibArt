                At a state fair, there is a jar containing jellybeans. It has 41 grape jellybeans, 41 cherry jellybeans, 31 butter jellybeans, and 14 licorice jellybeans, for a total of 127 jellybeans.
            Suppose you draw 2 jellybeans, setting each of them to the side as you pull them out. What is the probability that jellybean 1 is cherry flavored, and jellybean 2 is grape flavored?
            
        </p>
    </statement>
    <answer>
        <p>
            The probability is <m>\left( \frac{41}{127} \right)\left( \frac{41}{126} \right) = 0.10504936882889639</m>.
