                    A board is laid out in a grid. The top is broken into columns, labeled A to F, and the side is broken into rows, labeled 1 to 8. If you pick a spot on the board at random, what is the probability that the spot

                        <li> is in columns C to E or is in rows 5 to 8? </li>
                        <li> is not in columns C to E? </li>
