                    Some role playing games allow the player to change the course of the game by having conversations with characters and choosing different reponse options. This kind of system is called a dialog tree. Let's explore an example. Suppose that when you initiate a conversation with the innkeeper, you can choose from 2 initial questions to ask. After the innkeeper responds, you have 2 dialog choices to say in reply. When the innkeeper responds again, you have 3 ways you can end the conversation.
                    <ol>
                        <li>Draw a tree diagram to display all of the possible dialog choices you could make.</li>
                        <li>What is the total number of possible conversations you could have with the innkeeper?</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>

            <ol>
                <li>This should be checked by a human being. The tree should start with a dot and then have three successive layers after that. Draw 2 lines eminating from that initial dot and label the ends appropriately. From each of those ends, you should have 2 lines coming out. These should also be labeled. Finally, from each of the ends of the second layer, you should have 3 lines extending out and correctly labeled according to the problem.</li>
                <li>There are 12 total possibilities.</li>
            </ol>
