    <statement>
        <p> A hemisphere is positioned flat side up and a cylinder is attached cleanly to the top of the hemisphere. The dimensions of the shape are as follows: the hemisphere has radius 5 and the cylinder has side length 9, where everything is measured in millimeters.
            <ol>
                <li>Sketch a drawing of this situation to the best of your ability.</li>
                <li>Find the total volume of this shape.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
    </statement>
    <answer>
        <p>
            The volume is <m>V \approx 968.66</m> <m>mm^3</m>. This was computed using the formula <m>V = \frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 + \pi r^2h</m>.
