        <p>
            A certain virus is known to be present in about 2% of adults. Scientists have developed a new test for this virus. Based on their research, the new test has a false negative rate of 17% and a false positive rate of 2%. 
            <ol>
                <li>Draw a tree describing this situation.</li>
                <li>What is the probability that a randomly selected adult tests positive and is actually healthy?</li>
            </ol>

            <ol>
                <li>See the class notes for how to draw a tree.</li>
                <li>The probability is <me>P(positive\, and\, healthy) = P(healthy)P(positive|healthy) \approx 0.0196</me></li>
