            A survey asks 600 people the following question: "Do you prefer dogs or cats?" In their answer, the respondents can specify one of the two options, both, or neither. Suppose 248 reported that they prefer cats, 257 reported that they prefer neither dogs nor cats, 103 reported that they prefer both dogs and cats, and 95 reported that they prefer dogs only.
            <ol>
                <li>Draw a Venn diagram of the situation. Use the information in the problem to clearly label the diagram.</li>
                <li>How many people  reported that they prefer cats only?</li>
                <li>How many people  reported that they do not prefer dogs?</li>

            <ol>
                <li>In general you should draw overlapping circles contained in a larger rectangle. From the information given in this problem, 600 is the amount for the entire rectangle, 248 is the number for the entire cats circle, 257 is the number for the portion outside of both circles, 103 is the number for the little oval overlap part, and 95 is the number for the crescent moon part of dogs.</li>
                <li>145 reported that they prefer cats only.</li>
                <li>402 reported that they do not prefer dogs.</li>
