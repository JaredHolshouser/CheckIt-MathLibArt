    <statement>
        <p>
            A certain error is known to be present in about 10% of gadgets. Engineers have developed a new test for this error. Based on their research, the new test has a false negative rate of 9% and a false positive rate of 10%. 
            <ol>
                <li>Draw a tree describing this situation.</li>
                <li>What is the probability that a randomly selected gadget tests negative?</li>
            </ol>
        </p>

    <answer>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>See the class notes for how to draw a tree.</li>
                <li>The probability is <me>P(negative) = P(defective)P(negative|defective) + P(not defective)P(negative|not defective) \approx 0.819</me></li>
