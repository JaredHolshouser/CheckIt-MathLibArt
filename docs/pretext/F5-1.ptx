    <answer>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Their monthly payment is <m>\frac{P_0 (\frac{r}{n})}{1 - (1+\frac{r}{n})^{-nt}} = \frac{95000(\frac{0.046}{12})}{1 - (1 + \frac{0.046}{12})^{-12 \cdot 15}} = </m> $731.61.</li>
                <li>They will pay a total of <m>dnt = 731.61\cdot 12 \cdot15 = </m> $131,689.8 overall.</li>
                <li>They will pay <m>dnt - P_0 = 131689.8 - 95000 = </m> $36,689.8 in interest to the bank.</li>
